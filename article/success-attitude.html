				<h3>Success is All in the Attitude</h3>
				<h6><b>Author:</b> Admin, <b>Created:</b> 9th, Dec 2012</h6>

				<p><b>What's important to the success of small-business owners and entrepreneurs? Knowledge, skill and talent.</b></p>

				<p>However, many competitors have the same traits you do. The key to beating the competition and achieving success is mental, reflected in one's attitude, totally controlled by the individual and requires no cash. This holds true in most human endeavors besides business--in sports, the arts and politics.</p>

				<p>How many times have we seen the underdog team or player win over the more talented opponent? The difference is often attitude.</p>

				<p>Nor are we talking about having ‘attitude’ in the sense of acting tough.</p>

				<p>We are talking about Attitude as a major component of personality — the overall orientation of the mind, a fundamental mindset that is with you for life.Think of it as the lens through which you see your life unfolding.</p>

				<p>Work should be fun. Your passion will help you overcome difficult moments and persuade people to work for you and want to do business with you. Passion can't be taught. When it wanes, as it surely will in difficult times, take some quiet time. Whether it be an hour or a week, take inventory of all the reasons you started the business and why you like being your own boss. That should renew your passion.</p>
