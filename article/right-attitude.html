				<p><b>The ability to live more inwardly is the hallmark of right, spiritual attitude.</b></p>

				<p>Because the science of yoga deals so much with techniques and methods, many yoga students imagine the entire process of spiritual evolution to be a mere mechanism. They believe they can find God through technique alone.</p>

				<p>Mankind has always been somewhat prone to mistake technique for inspiration (such as when one is playing a musical instrument), forgetting that technique is merely a vehicle for inspiration. Yoga, which approaches the path to liberation more scientifically, also offers a temptation to confuse method with something infinitely more important on the path: right attitude.</p>

				<p>Remember, technique is only a vehicle. What good is a car in the hands of a driver who has no idea where he wants to go?</p>

				<p>The fact that yoga practice accelerates oneâ€™s spiritual progress only increases the need for right attitude. Socially responsible attitudes are more important for automobile drivers traveling at high speeds than for bicycle riders.</p>

				<p>Concentration on yoga techniques alone, without developing right attitudes, can prove dangerous. For spiritual progress can never be forced, any more than one can force the delicate mechanism of a watch.</p>

				<p>The ability to live more inwardly is the hallmark of right, spiritual attitude. Right attitude is the force that sets the wheel of spiritual evolution turning in the first place. Right attitude is what keeps it turning, drawing more and more divine power to itself. Right attitude it is, finally, that keeps the whirlpool of Self-realization expanding outward to infinity, instead of becoming locked in a narrow cycle of ego-limitation.</p>
